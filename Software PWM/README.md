# Software PWM
The objective of Software PWM was to generate a 1 kHz signal in order to increment the duty cylce of an LED from 0% to 100%. The initial duty cycle was set to 50% upon running the code. Each button press would increment the LED by 10% until it reached 100%. Once this occured, the cycle would revert to 0% and repeat.
