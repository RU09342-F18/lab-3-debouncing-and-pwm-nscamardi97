# Software Debouncing
Due to the mechanical nature of a button or switch, the functionality does not always behave as desired. In order to combat this, something referred to as "debouncing" can be implemented. Button bounce results in mutliple depressions being detected and a program not running exactly the way it should. The objective of this lab is correct this behavior using interrupts and timers.

# Dependencies
The only dependency for the code is the ```c <msp430.h> ```
